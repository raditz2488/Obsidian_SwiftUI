It is the latest design trend. The ui component stands out from the background using shadows. We need three colours
- Element colour - for the ui component and its background
- Shadow colour - Apply this as the shadow colour either the top left or bottom right corner
- Highlight colour - Apply this as the highlight colour either the top left or bottom right
The shadow and highlight colours are applied in diagonally opposite corners
